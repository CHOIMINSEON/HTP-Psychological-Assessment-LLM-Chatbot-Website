    "input": "The tree is large with many branches and deeply drawn roots",
    "interpretation": "This indicates significant growth potential and potentially underlying issues related to dependency or difficulty establishing boundaries. The expansive nature of both the tree and its roots suggests an overwhelming need for external support and resources, possibly reflecting feelings of insecurity or lack of self-esteem. It could also signify difficulties in forming healthy relationships due to excessive reliance on others."
  },
  {
    "input": "The house is small with no doors or windows, and no smoke from the chimney",
    "interpretation": "This suggests an underlying feeling of isolation, detachment, and possibly unresolved grief or loss. The lack of visual stimuli within the structure could indicate difficulty forming relationships or experiencing feelings of emptiness. It may also reflect difficulties coping with external pressures or challenges."
  },
  {
    "input": "The person's hands are hidden behind their back and the face has no expression",
    "interpretation": "In this context, it suggests defensiveness or difficulty expressing emotions openly. The obscured hand position might indicate anxiety about social interaction or fear of vulnerability. Additionally, without facial expression, there could be a reluctance to engage with others due to perceived judgment or insecurity regarding one’s own feelings. This is often associated with depression and low self-esteem within psychology assessments."
  },
  {
    "input": "The tree trunk has holes and the branches are drooping downward",
    "interpretation": "This indicates potential feelings of insecurity or instability in the individual's life experiences. The broken structure suggests difficulties coping with external pressures and potentially unresolved conflicts from past events. It could also represent underlying anxieties about future challenges. The overall impression points to an emotional state characterized by vulnerability and perhaps difficulty trusting oneself or others."
  },
  {
    "input": "The house has an excessively large roof with many complex decorations",
    "interpretation": "This suggests potential issues related to control, power dynamics within relationships, or difficulties managing overwhelming responsibilities at home due to excessive decoration reflecting an inflated sense of self-importance. The complexity indicates cognitive overactivity and potentially difficulty concentrating on practical tasks necessary for maintaining family stability."
  },
  {
    "input": "The tree is drawn in the corner with very thin trunk and sparse leaves",
    "interpretation": "This suggests a potential difficulty in establishing stable foundations or relationships. The lack of robustness indicates underlying instability and possibly feelings of insecurity related to emotional connections and support systems. It may reflect an avoidance strategy for vulnerability and dependence. Further exploration into anxiety-related themes could be warranted."
  },
  {
    "input": "The person is drawn very small at the bottom of the page with no facial features",
    "interpretation": "This suggests significant regression to earlier developmental stages or difficulty processing complex information due to fear or anxiety, potentially indicative of dissociation or disconnection from reality. The lack of detail reflects an inability to engage fully with external stimuli."
  },
  {
    "input": "The house has heavily shaded walls and windows with bars",
    "interpretation": "This indicates potential difficulties related to trust, vulnerability, or feelings of being restricted by relationships. The shading suggests avoidance of open communication and potentially underlying anxiety about personal connections. It could also represent an internalized fear of judgment or rejection. This feature is commonly associated with depressive symptoms and interpersonal distress within personality disorders."
  },
  {
    "input": "The tree has broken branches and appears to be leaning to one side",
    "interpretation": "This indicates potential instability or difficulty managing stress within the individual's life. The asymmetrical structure of both the house and person could signify an imbalance in their sense of self-worth and emotional regulation skills. It may reflect underlying anxiety or feelings of being overwhelmed by external pressures. Further exploration into coping mechanisms and support systems would be warranted."
  },
  {
    "input": "The person has unusually large hands and feet with exaggerated details",
    "interpretation": "This indicates potential difficulties regulating emotions or experiencing heightened sensory perceptions – specifically, an overabundance of sensation that may manifest as anxiety or hyperarousal. The detailed representation suggests intense feelings being experienced internally rather than externally observed situations."
